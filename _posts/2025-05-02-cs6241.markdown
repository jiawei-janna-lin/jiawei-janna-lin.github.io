Using the EU long-term dataset, we develop and compare three approaches: raw INS integration, an Extended Kalman Filter with Random Fourier Features (EKF-RFF) for state estimation, and a tensor- train-based Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) solver with Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) for optimal control synthesis.
